# Darkside changelog

## v7.16 (03.03.25)

To allow loading old and new CSS files that the same time, we have now renamed all classes to start with `.aksel` instead of `.navds`.
Every React component has this now feature-flagged behind using the new `Theme`-component.

- **With `<Theme />`**: All components uses `.aksel`-classes internally.
- **Without `<Theme />`**: All components uses `.navds`-classes internally like before.

This means you can now migrate parts of your application to use the new CSS classes without having to migrate everything at once.

```
// MyComponent.tsx
<div>
  // Uses old CSS
  <Button>Click me</Button>

  // Uses new CSS
  <Theme>
    <Button>Click me</Button>
  </Theme>
</div>
```
