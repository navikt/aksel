# Setup

## Clean project

For new projects, setup is just as easy as before, but now requires a `Theme`-component to be wrapped around your app.
The component acts as a local feature-flag for the new implementation, with the added benefit of being able to switch between light and dark mode for you.

Steps:

- 1. Import new CSS `@navikt/ds-css/darkside`
- 2. Import `Theme`-component from `@navikt/ds-react/Theme`
- 3. Wrap your app in the `Theme`-component. You do not have to set the theme, as you can manually handle theme switching with other tools like `next-themes`.

```tsx
import "@navikt/ds-css/darkside";
import { Theme } from "@navikt/ds-react/Theme";

export const App = () => (
  <Theme theme="light">
    <YourApp />
  </Theme>
);
```

### Only Tokens/CSS

If you are not using any of our React-components, you can still switch between themes by setting `class="light"` or `class="dark"` on your root-element.

## Theme switching

The `Theme`-component has a `theme`-prop that can be set to either `light` or `dark`. This only sets a `class` on the element of `light` or `dark` (in addition to a `aksel-theme` class), and the rest is handled by the CSS.

You have the option of using `hasBackground` (defaults to true) to make `Theme` include a built on default background.

Since theme-switching often is framework-spesific, we have not included a theme-toggle component or advanced logic for cookies/localstorage.
You will have to implement this yourself using a custom setup, or use a library like [next-themes](https://github.com/pacocoursey/next-themes).

We will continue to work on the whole `Theme` ecosystem, and might include more features in the future to handle this built in.

### Theme-switch component

This is context-based for what fits your application, but there are some general patterns you can follow.

- **Light or Dark-mode**: Here you can use a simple Switch-component, or a Tertiary-button to toggle between them.

- **Light, Dark or System-mode**: Here you can use a ToggleGroup or Select-component.

```tsx
isLightMode ? (
  <Button
    variant="tertiary-neutral"
    icon={<SunIcon title="Switch to dark theme" />}
  />
) : (
  <Button
    variant="tertiary-neutral"
    icon={<MoonIcon title="Switch to light theme" />}
  />
);
```

## I just want to test the new tokens

Since you can use the new tokens alongside the old tokens, you can start by importing the new tokens as you would the old system.

```css
@import "@navikt/ds-tokens/darkside-css";
```

For SCSS, Less and JS they are also available under the paths

```
@navikt/ds-tokens/darkside-scss
@navikt/ds-tokens/darkside-less
@navikt/ds-tokens/darkside-js
```

**Note: To support theming, scss, less and js tokens are all now based on `css-variables`. This means you will have to import the css-version from `darkside-css` alongside them for everything to work.**

## I want to test the new React-changes

For the new system to work with our components, you will have to use the new `Theme`-component, and import the new CSS from `@navikt/ds-css/darkside`

```tsx
import "@navikt/ds-css/darkside";
import { Theme } from "@navikt/ds-react/Theme";

export const App = () => (
  <Theme theme="light">
    <YourApp />
  </Theme>
);
```

You will have to check on all your custom overrides when making this switch.

### Partial update

You can migrate parts of your application to use the new CSS classes without having to migrate everything at once.

```tsx
// Old setup
import "@navikt/ds-css/darkside";
// New setup
import "@navikt/ds-css/darkside";
import { Theme } from "@navikt/ds-react/Theme";

export const App = () => (
  <div>
    <StillOnOldCSSComponent>
    /* Only this part of your app now uses new styling */
    <Theme>
      <YourApp />
    </Theme>
  </div>
);
```

You will have to check on all your custom overrides when making this switch.

## I have to make some custom changes in darkmode

Since our implementation is based on CSS, you can easily make custom adjustments where necessary.

```css
.my-component {
  background-color: var(--ax-bg-raised);
  color: var(--ax-text-neutral);
  border: 1px solid var(--ax-border-neutral-subtleA);
}

// Makes hover-state more visible only for darkmode
.dark .my-component {
  &:hover {
    border-color: var(--ax-border-accent-default);
  }
}
```

## Tailwind CSS

```
// Tailwind v3
module.exports = {
  presets: [require("@navikt/ds-tailwind/darkside-tw3")],
}
```
