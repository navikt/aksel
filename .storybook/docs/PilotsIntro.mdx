# Becoming a pilot team

We are looking for teams wanting to test our new theming implementation and darkmode before we go live with them later in 2025.

## What is a pilot team?

- A pilot team is a team that tests new implementations before they are released.
- The team will test the new implementation in a real-world scenario and provide us with feedback.
- The feedback will be used to improve the implementation before it replaces the old system.

As a pilot team, we want close communication to get
feedback on the changes. We want to know all the unclear and bad parts
of our implementations, so that we can fix them all up before the big release.

## Who are we mainly looking for?

We are focusing on applications meant for our internal systems and services for now. This line is often a little blurry,
but in short, all the public facing applications including those using "Dekoratøren" will not be considered internal.
Support for "Dekoratøren" is quite far down the road at the moment.

For teams wanting to test the new implementation, there are some key points to consider:

- You _probably_ want to be in the earlier stages of developing a new product or service (to more easily test something in isolation).
- You can test _any_ smaller subset of the new system as it's not an "all or nothing" ordeal. This could be: design tokens, darkmode, updated CSS or a combination of these.
- You have the capacity to test and provide feedback on the new implementation (You'll be saving Nav countless hours for every hour spent!).

Everyone is welcome to test the new implementation, but for some larger applications, it might be a bit early to adopt the new system. Keep in mind that there might be breaking changes as we go,
and we won't have all tooling ready for adoption yet so you might have to do some manual work.

## How to give feedback

We welcome all forms of feedback:

- **Issues**: [Open an issue on Github](https://github.com/navikt/aksel/issues)
- **Disussions**: [Start a discussion](https://github.com/navikt/aksel/discussions/categories/darkside).
- **Slack**: [Reach out to us on Slack #Aksel-designsystemet](https://nav-it.slack.com/archives/C7NE7A8UF)

## What's new?

- **Design tokens**: A complete re-write of our design tokens to allow for dark mode.
- **Dark mode**: A new dark mode implementation.
- **Updated CSS**: Now uses new tokens, built-in CSS-layers support and most components are re-written.
- **Updated Tailwind CSS config**: Now uses new tokens, now comes with built-in `ax`-prefix for easier separation between Aksel and your own config.
- **Updated components**: Components use the new tokens and CSS.
- **New Theme-component**: A new `<Theme/>`-component to handle the theming-switch locally.
- **Updated documentation**: Updated documentation for the new implementation.

## Documentation

As we go, we will add more documentation to help you get started with the new implementation.

- [Design i light og dark-mode](https://aksel.nav.no/god-praksis/artikler/design-i-dark-mode-og-light-mode)

### Demo page

We have a demo page to show off some of the new features and tokens. [You can find it here](https://aksel-referansesider.ansatt.dev.nav.no/aktivitetsplan/).
We recommend using "inspect-tool" in browser to get a feel for the new tokens and CSS.

## How testing could affect your application

All the changes are **opt in**, meaning you can choose to use nothing, some parts of the new implementation, or go all-in.
You will still be able to recieve updates to the old implementation while we are in the testing phase.

### Tokens

We have made a complete re-write of our design tokens to allow for dark mode.
This includes new backgrounds, text-colors, border-colors and updated spacing-tokens.

- All tokens have a new prefix `--ax` to avoid conflicts with old tokens.
- You will be able to use the new tokens at the same time as the old tokens.
- All background, text-colors and border-colors have new names and "concepts" to learn. Migration will not be a quick one to one with old system.
- New spacing tokens are now named `space` and based on `px` values (most devs think and deal in `px` values first, no more on-the-fly mental arithmetic! WYSIWYG).

### CSS

We have updated our CSS to be based on the new tokens for theming.

- Most of our CSS is re-written.
- All custom overrides targeting `.navds`-classes might have to be updated locally.
- Component-based tokens are no longer avaliable.

### Tailwind CSS

We have made a new Tailwind CSS config based on the new tokens. Based on previous iterations, we have decided to try prefixing all our classes with `ax-`.
While this will be a little more verbose, it makes it easier to separate your own config from ours, and hopefully makes it easier to maintain.

### React components

We have made some prop-changes to some components to facilitate the new theming and updated CSS. You can read more about them under `migration` in the sidebar.
We have hidden the changes behind a "feature-flag", so you will have to use the new `<Theme/>`-component when testing the new CSS.
