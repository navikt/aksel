# Darkside changelog

## v7.22 (12.05.25)

Updates to border-radius and text-icon tokens.

- **Border radius**: Now named just `radius`, and t-shirt sizing is replace with numbers reflecting the pixel value.
- **Text-icon**: Now named `text-decoration` to better reflect its usecases.

Migration-code trough the `@navikt/aksel` package has been updated to handle this change when migrating from legacy CSS to the new CSS.
As for the border-radius update, we have added fallback-support for the old `border-radius`-tokens, so you can use both the new and old tokens at the same time for now.

## v7.18 (02.04.25)

`<Theme />`-component no longer defaults to `light`-theme className when no theme is provided.

This change is made to make it possible to handle 'light' and 'dark' themes in a more flexible way. You can manually set `className="light"` (or dark) on any html-element higher in the hierarchy, and the `<Theme />`-component will not override this.
One of the cases where this is needed is with `next-themes` where defaulting to light, and changing to dark based on `useTheme`-hook from `next-themes` leads to hydratiob errors.

## v7.16 (03.03.25)

To allow loading old and new CSS files that the same time, we have now renamed all classes to start with `.aksel` instead of `.navds`.
Every React component has this now feature-flagged behind using the new `Theme`-component.

- **With `<Theme />`**: All components uses `.aksel`-classes internally.
- **Without `<Theme />`**: All components uses `.navds`-classes internally like before.

This means you can now migrate parts of your application to use the new CSS classes without having to migrate everything at once.

```

// MyComponent.tsx

<div>
  // Uses old CSS
  <Button>Click me</Button>

// Uses new CSS

  <Theme>
    <Button>Click me</Button>
  </Theme>
</div>
```
