# Becoming a pilot team

We are looking for teams wanting to test our new theming implementation and darkmode before we go live with them later in 2025.

## What is a pilot team?

- A pilot team is a team that tests new implementations before they are released.
- The team will test the new implementation in a real-world scenario and provide feedback us with feedback.
- The feedback will be used to improve the implementation before it replaces the old system.

As a pilot team, we want close communication to get
feedback on the changes. We want to know all the unclear and bad parts
of our implementations, so that we can improve them incrementally before the big release.

## Who are we mainly looking for?

We are focusing on applications meant for our internal systems and services for now. This line is often a little blurry,
but can be categorized as all applications using "Dekoratøren" will not be considered internal.
Support for "Dekoratøren" is quite far down the road at the moment.

For teams wanting to test the new implementation, there are some key points to consider:

- They are in the early stages of developing a new product or service.
- They are able to test either design tokens, darkmode, updated CSS or a combination of these.
- Have the capacity to test and provide feedback on the new implementation.

But be aware that there might be breaking changes as we go,
and we won't have all tooling ready for adoption yet so you might have to do some manual work.

## What's new?

- **Design tokens**: A complete re-write of our design tokens to allow for dark mode.
- **Dark mode**: A new dark mode implementation.
- **Updated CSS**: Now uses the new tokens, and with built-in CSS-layers support.
- **Updated components**: Components use the new tokens and CSS.
- **New Theme-component**: A new `<Theme/>`-component to handle the theming-switch locally.
- **Updated documentation**: Updated documentation for the new implementation.

## How testing could affect your application

All the changes are **opt in**, meaning you can choose to use nothing, some parts of the new implementation, or go all inn.
You will still be able to recieve updates to the old implementation while we are in the testing phase.

### Tokens

We have made a complete re-write of our design tokens to allow for dark mode.
This includes new backgrounds, text-colors, border-colors and updated spacing-tokens.

- All tokens have a new prefix `--ax` to avoid conflicts with old tokens.
- You will be able to use the new tokens at the same time as the old tokens.
- All background, text-colors and border-colors have new names and "concepts" to learn. Migration will not be a quick one to one with old system.
- New spacing tokens are now names `space` and based on `px`-names.

### CSS

We have updated our CSS to be based on the new tokens for theming.

- Most of our CSS is re-written.
- All custom overrides targeting `.navds`-classes might have to be updated locally.
- You will not be able to use the old CSS and the new CSS at the same time.
- Component-based tokens are no longer avaliable.

### React components

We have made some prop-changes to some components to facilitate the new theming and updated CSS. You can read more about them under `migration` in the sidebar.
We have hidden the changes behind a "feature-flag", so you will have to use the new `<Theme/>`-component when testing the new CSS.
