# Reference vs Embedding Content

When should content be linked (referenced) vs copied (embedded)? This decision affects reusability, query complexity, and editing workflows.

## The Trade-offs

| Aspect           | Reference                           | Embedded Object           |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Reusability      | ✅ Shared across documents          | ❌ Copied per document    |
| Single source    | ✅ Update once, reflects everywhere | ❌ Must update each copy  |
| Query complexity | Requires joins/expansion            | Inline, simpler queries   |
| Editing UX       | Separate editing interface          | All fields in one place   |
| Independence     | Can exist on its own                | Only exists within parent |

## When to Reference

Use references when content:

- **Is reusable** — Same author across many articles
- **Needs central management** — Update product info once
- **Has its own lifecycle** — Published/draft independent of parent
- **Should stay in sync** — Price changes reflect everywhere

**Examples:**

- Author profiles
- Product catalog items
- Shared testimonials
- Category taxonomy
- Reusable CTAs

## When to Embed

Use embedded objects when content:

- **Is unique to this document** — Page-specific hero
- **Doesn't make sense alone** — SEO metadata
- **Should be copied, not linked** — Historical snapshot
- **Simplifies editing** — All fields in one form

**Examples:**

- SEO metadata
- Page-specific sections
- Address information
- Social links
- Configuration options

## Sanity Implementation

```typescript
// Reference: Author is reusable
defineField({
  name: "author",
  type: "reference",
  to: [{ type: "author" }],
});

// Embedded: SEO is page-specific
defineField({
  name: "seo",
  type: "object",
  fields: [
    defineField({ name: "title", type: "string" }),
    defineField({ name: "description", type: "text" }),
  ],
});
```

## The Hybrid Approach

Sometimes you want both: a reference for the canonical data, plus embedded overrides.

```typescript
defineField({
  name: "featuredProduct",
  type: "object",
  fields: [
    defineField({
      name: "product",
      type: "reference",
      to: [{ type: "product" }],
    }),
    defineField({
      name: "overrideTitle",
      type: "string",
      description: "Optional: Override the product title for this context",
    }),
  ],
});
```

Query uses `coalesce(overrideTitle, product->title)`.
