# Becoming a pilot team

<Title>What is a pilot team?</Title>

We are looking for pilot teams to test our new theming and design
implementation, including darkmode. We are mainly looking for teams
that are in the early stages of developing a new product or service.
We want to test our system in a real-world scenario, and we need
your help to do so.
