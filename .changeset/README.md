# Changesets

To handle versioning and released, we use [Changesets](https://github.com/changesets/changesets) to [version](https://semver.org/) and publish our packages.

## Howto

- To create a new version, run `yarn changeset`
- select versions to change with arrowkeys + spacebar

`ðŸ¦‹ Which packages would you like to include?`

- Press the `Space` key to select `changed packages`, then press `Enter` to move to the next question.

`ðŸ¦‹ Which packages should have a major bump?`

- Press the `Enter` key to select none and move to the next question, _*or*_ navigate packages using the arrow keys and press the `Space` key to select the packages with changes that should target a major version.

`ðŸ¦‹ Which packages should have a minor bump?`

- Press the `Enter` key to select none so that your changes automatically target a patch bump, _*or*_ select packages using the up and down arrow keys and space if your changes should target a minor version.

- Commit and push up.
