# Migration

## Tokens

[See tokens docs here](https://main--66b4b3beb91603ed0ab5c45e.chromatic.com/?path=/docs/docs-become-a-pilot-team-4-tokens--docs).

## CSS

- Most of our CSS is re-written. This could potentially affect most custom overrides targeting `.navds`-classes.
- You will not be able to use the old CSS and the new CSS at the same time.

As we strongly recommend avoiding custom
overrides where possible, we would like to encourage opening an
issue if you find that you have to override our CSS to achieve
something! It's these cases we want to know about so that we can fix
them for everyone.

### Removed component-tokens

All component-spesific tokens are no longer supported. That means all tokens like these from `Button` are removed:

```css
--ac-button-primary-bg
--ac-button-primary-text
--ac-button-primary-hover-bg
--ac-button-primary-active-bg
```

All component-based tokens are prefixed with `--ac`, so a global search in your codebase should find all of them.

## React

We have made some updates to `@navikt/ds-react` that you should be aware of before testing.

### Accordion

#### Props

- `variant` is deprecated and will be removed in the future. We have not implemented it in the new system.
- `headingSize` is deprecated and will be removed in the future. Accordion-size medium now equals `small` heading, and size small equals `xsmall` heading.

#### Structural changes

`<Accordion.Content/>` now has an extra nested `div` to allow for better animations. Custom CSS might break.

### Datepicker

Weeknumber-button uses our own button-component, and no longer a
custom button.

### GuidePanel

Component got a complete overhaul. Custom overrides might break.

### Popover, HelpText, Tooltip

`arrow`-prop is removed. All of our floating dialog-elements now come without arrow.
If you have custom `offset`-values, you might have to update them to accommodate this.

### Pagination

Button now uses our own button-component and `variant="tertiary-neutral".

### Primitives

Given that these are closely tied to our tokens, you will most
likely have to update parts of them to test the new system.

All primitives using our current `spacing`-tokens now has
the new <code>space</code>-tokens. You can use the old tokens while
testing, but the full release will remove them from the prop-list

<Markdown>
{`
\`\`\`diff
- <HStack gap="4">
+ <HStack gap="space-16">
\`\`\`

`}

</Markdown>

#### Page

`background`-prop is removed. Now just uses `bg-default`-token.

#### Box

Since `<Box />` is directly tied to our tokens, we
now offer `<Box.New />` as a temporary altenative. This
component is based on our new tokens and can use the backgrounds,
borders, border-radius and shadows from the new system. When the full release comes, we will update `<Box />` to use the new system, and provide tooling to handle this migration.

**All instances of `<Box />` will break when using the new system if:**

- `background`-prop is used
- `shadow`-prop is used
- `borderColor`-prop is used
