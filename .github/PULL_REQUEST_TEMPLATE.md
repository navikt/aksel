#### New component? ✨

- Check that component-styling is correctly configured in `@navikt/core/css/config/_mappings.js`. This is needed for correct build and CDN upload.
- Check that styling is correctly exported from `@navikt/core/css/index.css`
- Check that correct tokens for component is documented in `@navikt/core/css/tokens.json`

- Add JSDoc to component (see other components for reference)
- Create storybook-stories for relevant component variations and compositions. Stories are used for [visual regression testing](https://www.chromatic.com/docs/), so make sure they are complete.
- Is the component sufficiently complex to warrant tests? Add some unit-tests for vitest.

#### Component-updates 🎉
